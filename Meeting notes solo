Week 1 notes -

I've decided to look into the mobile app; some information about this is as following:
  **functional requirements  | ability to take customer text inputs for reviews, 
  be able to link to a product database which has information about products, 
  services and stock counts. Ability to hold payments and potentially store this information for later purchases (must be secure)**

â€¢	The group discusses on what data are required by a subsystem for one user type but must be provided by other subsystems. 
 -Information of products
 -Usernames
 -Passwords
 -Prices
 -Stock count
 -Payment information
 -Item locations
