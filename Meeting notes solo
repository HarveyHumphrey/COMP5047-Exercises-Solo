Week 1 notes -

I've decided to look into the mobile app; some information about this is as following:
  **functional requirements  | ability to take customer text inputs for reviews, 
  be able to link to a product database which has information about products, 
  services and stock counts. Ability to hold payments and potentially store this information for later purchases (must be secure)**
